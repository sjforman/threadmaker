# Threadmaker

Threadmaker makes it easy to compose threads on Twitter. 

It's live on the web at https://threadmaker.now.sh. 

It was bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 

Thanks to: 

 * [@mrmrs](https://github.com/mrmrs) for [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/)
 * [@jxnblk](https://github.com/jxnblk) for a handful of [Geomicons](http://jxnblk.com/Geomicons/)

This is a hobby project built for personal use and as an educational exercise.

It's offered freely, but without warranty of perfect functioning. 

So if something doesn't work for you, please feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/sjforman/threadmaker/issues/new), or, better,  
[a pull request](https://github.com/sjforman/threadmaker/pulls).
